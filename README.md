## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Typescript]
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite


### What I learned

Applying Typescript to new Project is such a big challenge for me. Especially I spent hours of debugging my code because of TS. However it is very useful since it can point out my mistakes before I deploy my app

I will definitely use it in later on for other projects as well.
